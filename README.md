# Loops-in-cpp

Aim: To study and implement different types of loops like for while nested for , etc in C++.

Tools: GNU g++ compiler (for local execution)Any code editor or an Online C++ Compiler)

# Theory : 

Loops in C++ are useful to **replicate a block of code** over and over again until a certain condition is false. Loops will also allow you to automate repetitious tasks, eliminate redundancies in your code, and allow you to manage iterations to process a group of data efficiently. Two common loops that can be visited for these actions are **for loop** and **while loop**.
